# ArduinoDUE-Interfacing-BMI270

Important :
  1. I have not used [SparkFun_BMI270_Arduino_Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BMI270_Arduino_Library) because I assumed we do not have SparkFun BMI270 6DoF IMU Breakout but rather only a standalone working BMI270 IMU. I have used the API provided directly by Bosh Sensor Tech [BMI270_Sensor_API](https://github.com/boschsensortec/BMI270_SensorAPI) to connect to the BMI270 IMU.

  2. Due to lack of avability of BMI270 I cannot verify the working of the code on actual hardware setup. I have verified part of the code working by making some fake sensor data and performing state calculations on it. This is available in the file ______.

  3. I have explained parts of the code below. Refer to comments given in code for in-depth understanding.

## Part 1 : Connecting To BMI270

## Part 2 : Calculating States from Sensor Data

## Part 3 : Audio and Visual Representation Of States
